# WeightBoost: A New Boosting Algorithm Using Input-Dependent Regularizer

## 1. Introduction and Motivation

Boosting is a powerful ensemble learning technique that combines multiple weak learners to create a strong classifier. Among boosting algorithms, AdaBoost has been one of the most successful and widely used methods. However, despite its success, AdaBoost suffers from two major limitations:

1. **Overfitting Problem**: AdaBoost tends to overemphasize hard-to-classify samples, which can lead to overfitting, especially in noisy datasets. This is because AdaBoost exponentially increases the weights of misclassified samples, causing the algorithm to focus excessively on potentially noisy or outlier samples.

2. **Fixed Weight Combination Problem**: AdaBoost uses fixed constants (α values) to combine base classifiers without considering the input patterns. This means that each base classifier contributes equally across all regions of the input space, regardless of its performance in specific regions.

The WeightBoost algorithm addresses these limitations by introducing an **input-dependent regularizer** that makes the combination weights a function of the input. This allows each base classifier to contribute only in the regions of the input space where it performs well, while the regularization mitigates the impact of noisy data.

## 2. Algorithm Description

### 2.1 AdaBoost Algorithm

The AdaBoost algorithm works as follows:

1. Initialize sample weights: $w_i = \frac{1}{n}$ for all samples.
2. For each iteration $t = 1, 2, ..., T$:
   - Train a weak classifier $h_t$ on the weighted training data.
   - Calculate the weighted error: $\epsilon_t = \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i \cdot \mathbb{1}(h_t(x_i) \neq y_i) / \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i$
   - Compute the classifier weight: $\alpha_t = \frac{1}{2} \ln\left(\frac{1-\epsilon_t}{\epsilon_t}\right)$
   - Update sample weights: $w_i \leftarrow w_i \cdot \exp(-\alpha_t \cdot y_i \cdot h_t(x_i))$
   - Normalize weights: $w_i \leftarrow \frac{w_i}{\sum_{j=1}^{n} w_j}$
3. Final classifier: $H(x) = \text{sign}\left(\sum_{t=1}^{T} \alpha_t \cdot h_t(x)\right)$

### 2.2 WeightBoost Algorithm

The WeightBoost algorithm introduces an input-dependent regularizer to the AdaBoost framework:

1. Initialize sample weights: $w_i = \frac{1}{n}$ for all samples.
2. Initialize cumulative classifier output: $H_0(x_i) = 0$ for all samples.
3. For each iteration $t = 1, 2, ..., T$:
   - Train a weak classifier $h_t$ on the weighted training data.
   - Calculate the weighted error: $\epsilon_t = \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i \cdot \mathbb{1}(h_t(x_i) \neq y_i) / \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i$
   - Compute the classifier weight: $\alpha_t = \frac{1}{2} \ln\left(\frac{1-\epsilon_t}{\epsilon_t}\right)$
   - Update cumulative classifier output: $H_t(x_i) = H_{t-1}(x_i) + \alpha_t \cdot h_t(x_i)$
   - Calculate regularization factor: $r_i = \exp(-\beta \cdot |H_t(x_i)|)$
   - Update sample weights: $w_i \leftarrow \exp(-y_i \cdot H_t(x_i)) \cdot r_i$
   - Normalize weights: $w_i \leftarrow \frac{w_i}{\sum_{j=1}^{n} w_j}$
4. Final classifier: $H(x) = \text{sign}\left(H_T(x)\right)$

Where:
- $\beta$ is the regularization parameter that controls the strength of the input-dependent regularization.
- $r_i = \exp(-\beta \cdot |H_t(x_i)|)$ is the input-dependent regularizer.

The key difference in the prediction phase is that WeightBoost uses the regularization factor when combining the base classifiers:

$$H_T(x) = \sum_{t=1}^{T} \alpha_t \cdot e^{-\beta|H_{t-1}(x)|} \cdot h_t(x)$$

This formula allows each base classifier to contribute only in the regions of the input space where it performs well, as determined by the cumulative classifier output $H_{t-1}(x)$.

### 2.3 Theoretical Advantages

The input-dependent regularizer in WeightBoost provides several theoretical advantages:

1. **Adaptive Regularization**: The regularization strength adapts to the input pattern, being stronger in regions where the model is already confident (high $|H_{t-1}(x)|$) and weaker in uncertain regions.

2. **Noise Resistance**: By reducing the influence of base classifiers in regions where the model is already confident, WeightBoost is less likely to overfit to noisy samples.

3. **Region-Specific Contribution**: Each base classifier contributes more in regions where previous classifiers are uncertain, leading to a more specialized ensemble.
